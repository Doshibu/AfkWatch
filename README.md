First project using Symfony2.8.
The goal is to simulate a streaming web site presenting Movies & Series data.
This project has nothing illegal and only display trailer at the moment.
But the whole thing is built to render something that could actually fully work with the specific environnement (user, comment, share, social media api, admin side, proposal form to add content for everyone).

Here is the current main slide of the project.
